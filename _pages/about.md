# üåüAbout Me
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Transportation Engineering at Tongji University, supervised by Prof. [Jian Sun](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm). My research focuses on social behaviors in driving interactions and human-computer interaction (HCI) technologies for autonomous driving systems.

[**Project**](https://github.com/zxc-tju/InterHub) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- A unified naturalistic driving dataset with dense interactions is built by integrating and organizing multiple public datasets, providing a clear and accessible resource for studying complex traffic behaviors.

- A formal, quantitative definition of driving interactions, paired with an open-source toolkit, enables effective analysis and application across autonomous driving tasks.
